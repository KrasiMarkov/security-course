### [S-#] Storing the password on-chain makes it visible to anyone and no longer private


**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to anyone, and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable and only accessed through the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function., which is intended to be only called by the owner of the contract.

**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severly breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:**

The below test case shows how anyone can read the password directly from the blockchain.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
